Although mental illness is just as common as physical illness, it is surrounded by shame, stigma and fear which isolates people when they need support the most. So many of our friends and family are having to suffer in silence.

Awareness of and support for those affected by mental health issues needs to be a priority. Everyone deserves a happy and wholesome life. Mpower is a fight for equality.I want everyone with a mental illness to be understood and treated just like any other illness is treated. Great things can be achieved, if we all worked together to #HAPPY CORE<br> <br>
we publish real stories by real people, living with disability, disease and mental illness. They aim to build a safe platform for their community to share their stories, connect with others and raise support for the causes they believe in.I couldn’t imagine how my mind would be if I had to do the same tasks every day with no breaks. Your brain was not wired for monotony. We are curious creatures and being able to go to new places allows our brain to discover things it didn’t think was possible and allows us to see the world from another perspective. New places, new culture, new foods, the list goes on. Our brain has to put in extra power to be able to adapt, and this helps improve the overall health of your mental health. 
Our vision is for a world with good mental health for all. Our mission is to help people understand, protect and sustain their mental health. Prevention is at the heart of what we do, because the best way to deal with a crisis is to prevent it from happening in the first place.
